### Storage Files

The WYSIWYG field type dumps content to a corresponding `storage file`. The path to this file will be visible underneath the editor when `app.debug` is enabled.

You can edit this file directly and it will automatically sync back and forth with the database value. This is for convenience only, never commit the storage directory.
